Initialize project HR - Balanced Bracket Stack

This program is a solution to HackerRank problem Balanced Bracket Stacks.

Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket
(i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or })
of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of
brackets: [], {}, and ().

A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses
are not matched. For example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents in
between { and } are not balanced. The pair of square brackets encloses a single,
unbalanced opening bracket, (, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single,
unbalanced closing square bracket, ].

Given n strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced.
If a string is balanced, print YES on a new line; otherwise, print NO on a new line.
